# Snowflake4s
**A k-sortable unique ID generation lib using Scala.**

Snowflake4s can generate the roughly-sorted 64 bits ids as Long type written by Scala. The name of this lib was inspired by a project from Twitter called "Snowflake". So it's using the same encoded ID format as Twitter's Snowflake, but Snowflake4s providing the easier way to use Snowflake schema.

## Get Started
You should add the following dependency.
```sbtshell
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("ngtung", "snowflake4s")

libraryDependencies += "septech.snowflake4s" % "snowflake4s_2.12" % "0.0.1"
```

Add manual config to `application.conf`:
```hocon
snowflake4s {
  twitter { # using Twitter's algorithm
    machine_id = 1 # from 1 to 31
    worker_id = 1 # from 1 to 31 
  }
}
```

## How to use
to generate id:
```scala
val IdGenerator = Snowflake4s.generator

val id = IdGenerator.generate()
```

You also could bulk generate 10 ids with the following snippet: 
```scala
val IdGenerator = Snowflake4s.generator

val ids = IdGenerator.bulkGenerate(10)
```
